need to download and put additional file

file structure: moviie > node_modules & .next

moviie link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16-UV5lYUVL9dxnfNTF6hHobEZifeeIxC?usp=drive_link

too big file cannot upload directly into github

steps
1. download node_modules
2. put the node_modules folder inside moviie (refer file structure)
3. run in terminal "yarn install"
